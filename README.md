# Double Trouble

You are feeling lucky and want to gamble your hardly earned money?

## What does this mod do?

When you land on the Company outpost and if you're lucky, a Double Trouble event might happen.
When it does and you leave the outpost, you'll have 50/50 chance to either double your money, or loose half of it.
**Do you feel lucky enough to try?**

*Note: You can configure it to double/halves the money you made this round instead of "everything".*
