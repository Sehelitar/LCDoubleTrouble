# Double Trouble

You are feeling lucky and want to gamble your hardly earned money?

## What does this mod do?

When you land on the Company outpost and if you're lucky, a Double Trouble event might happen.
When you leave the outpost, you'll have 50/50 to either double your money, or loose half of it.
